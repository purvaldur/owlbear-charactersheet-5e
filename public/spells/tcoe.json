On a critical hit, the blade deals an extra 8d12 force damage (for a total of 12d12 force damage).\nAs a bonus action on your turn, you can move the blade up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see and then make up to two melee spell attacks with it again.\nThe blade can harmlessly pass through any barrier, including a {@spell wall of force}.\n",
